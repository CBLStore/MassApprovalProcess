## App Details

In default, Salesforce lacks a centralized screen for approving or rejecting pending items in bulk. Users are typically required to individually
click on each item to process approvals. However, this component, developed on the Lightning Web Components (LWC) framework, addresses this limitation by providing
a user-friendly interface where users can select multiple records and swiftly approve or reject them with a simple click of the "Approve" or "Reject" button. 
Due to its lightweight and efficient nature, LWC framework ensures speedy performance within the Salesforce platform. As a versatile solution, this component 
can be seamlessly integrated into various parts of the Salesforce interface. This initial commit marks the inception of this powerful tool.
